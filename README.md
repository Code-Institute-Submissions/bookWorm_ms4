# Code Institute Milestone Project 4
## A Full Stack Framework with Django 

### <a style="font=Leckerli+One">  bookWorm </a> we love a good read

##Site purpose

This is a test of an English language webnovel publishing site of a type popular in China and of growing popularity elsewhere. The owner's purpose is to provide a source of new eNovels and eManga as well as other online publications that will be if interest to readers. The owner will gather income from purchase of access to publications and individual chapters are usually provided as the main products. Titles are often published in a serialised form with readers awaiting the next installment. Typical access is via mobile devices. The site provides a basic reader function to access content linked to registered user accounts. Some content is normally provided for free as a taster and the site free content is available to any reader. 

The owner also wishes to recruit writers attracted to contribute their work to the genres onsite to become providers of future content as well as translators to provide English and other language content. These users will be paid a fee for their work on paid content. 

Users purchase titles by purchasing credit in their profile on the site using a card (in reality usually methods such as WeChat or Alipay dominate). These then allow purchase of chapters. The presence of credit encourages users to keep returning to the site. Other payment schemes such as subscriptions exist but these are outside the scope of this demo project 


##About bookWorm. 

This a prototype e-commerce site for promotion of inclusive new literature in the competitive e-novels/comics market. 

Site users can browse titles according to type (book, comic) or genre (sci-fi, fantasy or historical). After registration and login users can read sample chapters and then choose to purchase further chapters or a subscription. Users can then review the products they buy. Users can also submit their own works for online publication and/or may offer to act as translators for new works users will receive payment for this. 

## Demo

![Project Demo](/UXD/Demo.png)
### Design choices
The design process began with the bookWorm brand logo which uses a strong blue. From this to provide a fresh look I chose a palette based on shades of blue and green selected using the palette tool at [Coolors)(https://coolors.co/). Many aspects of the design use bootstrap components for consistency but to give a modern look they have been restyled as, for example, the navbar toggler button which has no border in order to give it a more contemporary look. The font choice for the logo, was determined by experimentation using [Fontastic]() and provides an appealing visual pun.  The design seeks to provide a visually consistent, responsive and easy to navigate user experience.

[landing page with 'Show titles' dropdown]()
The layout of the navbar, home and product pages use the format of the Code Instiute BoutiqueAdo project. I chose to retain the format of the 4 navbar buttons including the 'Show Titles' dropdown which provides functions that could be seen as redundant with that of the 'sort by menu'. However the 'sort by menu' appears only on the product pages and therefore I felt it was valuable to users to have the ability to be able to perform the wider searches provided by this dropdown directly from other locations especially from the landing page. 

## UX

I looked at the other project ideas given by the Code Institute and worked them into my idea: 

**Potential features to include:**
* An online store focused on selling new eLiterature

* Allow users to search items based on various fields, e.g. type, genre, author, rating

* Allow users to filter items based on title, genre, language, rating

* Allow users to see the price, image, ratings and other basic details of titles on the search page

* When viewing a title, users would be able to identify its content and suitability, read a sample, purchase more material, leave a rating

* Allow users to securely purchase title chapters, allow authors/translators to receive payments

* Users have to be registered to purchase, rate, create or translate 

* Allow registered users to write reviews about the titles, only if they purchased them

* Include pagination and/or other dynamic and responsive display actions.


### User Stories

This site is intended for readers and creators of new eNovels, eComics and other literary works in the growing foreign language publications market of east Asia. These publications re typically provided on a chapter by chapter basis offereing novel challenges in terms of dealing with management and presentation of products.

* to be able to buy related titles
* be part of the community by creating or translating new works
* do all the above on an easily navigated and attractive website 
**_"As an author I would like to"_**

### Design

I wanted to style the website with a fresh, inviting colour palette. It seekd to promote easy navigation through consistent use f well recognised icons in standard locations. In partcular when hadling very large numbers of products and large blocks of text there is a need to provide suitable navigation buttons that react responsively. 

#### Colour Scheme

![Colour Palette](UXD/colour-palette.png)

| Hex Colour Code   |  RGB   | Description   | 
| ------------- |-------------|:-------------:| 
| #F0F0F0     |240, 240, 240 | cultured|
| #D8FDDA    |216, 253, 218| nyanza|
| #FFE785    |255, 231, 133| crayola yellow   |
| #1ec32b       |30, 195, 43| dark pastel green     | 
| #00F       | 0, 0, 255 | blue|
| #694F5D       | 105, 79, 93 | eggplant|
| #000000     | 0, 0, 0 | black |




#### Typography
Fonts chosen were

#### Icons

I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) for the icons in this project

### Wireframes
 
[Here are the intitial wireframes](UXD)

## Features

- use pagination to move through the purchased publications
- manage my purchases, subscriptions, payments

##Limitations of this test site

The site content was harvested from datasets provided by Kaggle. The majority of titles have no chapters available and so a user can only browse as far as the title detail page. Though there is an add to bag link to purchase titles 

### Comments on coding required

My intial implementation of Stripe was based on that in the boutique_ado checkout method. This was written for a bag that has fixed contents already present in it. However, when using this in bookWorm topup_coins.html and the function in bookCoins/view.py this couldn't create the PaymentIntent.
 
Then I used a method to post data from the frontend to the backend to pass the user input and use it to create the PaymentIntent object. The posted data was stored as a session variable. When using this data to create PaymentIntent there was a resulting error because I had set a default value of 0 and on loading the page this resulted in an error as the PaymentIntent amount needed to be >0.

I then set this default value to 5 which created PaymentIntent successfully. However, when posting user input values to the backend this created addtitional PaymentIntent objects so that submitting the form led to only the default PaymentIntent being charged. 

To overcome this instead of creating a PaymentIntent object each time the user input was updated I overwrote the amount in the existing object.

## Credits 

### Media

The 

Inspiration for the bookWorm logo came from font choices at [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
I found the book dataset with images and ratings at [kaggle.com]() these were manually filtered to exclude some categories, the csv file was then formatted to JSON using  a snippet found (here](); the [gothic novel]() dataset was manually formatted to...
Various eNovel sites were consulted for inspiration including:

The base image is from [Pexels]()

### Code
*Product page pagination uses the code for page view pagination from
